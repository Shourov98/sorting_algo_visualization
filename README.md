# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the **Sorting Algorithm Visualizer**! This project is a React-based web application that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides an interactive and educational way to understand how different sorting algorithms work by animating the sorting process step by step.

## Features

- **Visualize Sorting Algorithms**: Watch how different sorting algorithms process and sort an array in real-time.
- **Supported Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Customizable Array Size**: Adjust the size of the array to see how the algorithms perform with different data sizes.
- **Speed Control**: Control the speed of the visualization to better understand each step of the sorting process.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web development.
- **Webpack**: A module bundler for JavaScript and friends.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and animations.
